/*
a) Obtain three numbers from the keyboard, compute their product and display the result.
1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
2. Read the first number from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
3. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
4. Read the second number from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
5. Prompt the user to enter the third number.
6. Read the third number from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
7. Compute the product of the three numbers by multiplying them together and store the result in a variable.
8. Display the result to the user.

b) Obtain two numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display which (if either) is the smaller of the two numbers
1. Prompt the user to enter the first number.
2. Read the first number from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
3. Prompt the user to enter the second number.
4. Read the second number from the keyboard and store it in a variable.
5. If the first number is less than the second number, display "The first number is smaller."
6. If the second number is less than the first number, display "The second number is smaller."
7. If the two numbers are equal, display "The two numbers are equal."

c) Obtain a series of positive numbers from the keyboard, and determine and display their average.
 Assume that the user types the sentinel value -1 to indicate “end of data entry.”
 1. Initialize a variable called `total` to zero and a variable called `count` to zero.
2. Repeat the following until the user enters the sentinel value (-1):
   a. Prompt the user to enter a positive number.
   b. Read the number from the keyboard.
   c. If the number is positive, add it to the `total` and increment the `count`.
3. If the `count` is greater than zero, compute the average by dividing the `total` by the `count`.
4. Display the average to the user.
